# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python web application using Litestar framework with GraphQL support via Strawberry GraphQL. The project follows modern Python development practices with strict type checking and comprehensive linting.

## Development Commands

### Package Management
- **Install dependencies**: `uv sync --all-extras --dev`
- **Add a dependency**: `uv add <package>`
- **Add a dev dependency**: `uv add --dev <package>`

### Testing
- **Run all tests**: `uv run pytest` or `uv run py.test`
- **Run a specific test**: `uv run pytest tests/test_app.py::test_hello_world`
- **Watch mode (auto-test)**: `uv run pytest-watcher`

### Code Quality
- **Run all checks**: `uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format . --check && uv run mypy .`
- **Lint code**: `uv run ruff check .`
- **Format code**: `uv run ruff format .`
- **Type checking**: `uv run mypy .`

### Running the Application
- **Development server**: `uv run litestar run --reload`
- **Production server**: `uv run litestar run`

## Architecture

### Application Structure
- **src/app/__init__.py**: Main application module containing:
  - REST endpoint at `/` returning "Hello, world!"
  - GraphQL endpoint at `/graphql` with Strawberry GraphQL schema
  - Litestar application instance configured with route handlers

### Key Components
1. **Litestar Framework**: Modern async Python web framework handling HTTP requests
2. **Strawberry GraphQL**: Type-safe GraphQL implementation using Python type hints
3. **Testing**: Uses pytest with Litestar's TestClient for integration testing

### Configuration
- **pyproject.toml**: Central configuration for dependencies, tools, and project metadata
- **Strict Type Checking**: mypy configured with strict mode enforcing type safety
- **Comprehensive Linting**: ruff configured with extensive rule sets for code quality

## Doctests

**All functions and methods MUST have working doctests.** Doctests serve as both documentation and tests.

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Doctests MUST actually execute - never comment out function calls or similar
- Doctests MUST NOT be converted to `.. code-block::` as a workaround (code-blocks don't run)
- If you cannot create a working doctest, **STOP and ask for help**

**Available tools for doctests:**
- `doctest_namespace` fixtures: `tmp_path`
- Ellipsis for variable output: `# doctest: +ELLIPSIS`
- Update `conftest.py` to add new fixtures to `doctest_namespace`

**`# doctest: +SKIP` is NOT permitted** - it's just another workaround that doesn't test anything. Use fixtures properly.

**Using fixtures in doctests:**
```python
>>> from litestar.testing import TestClient
>>> from app import app
>>> client = TestClient(app)
>>> response = client.get("/")
>>> response.status_code
200
```

## Git Commit Standards

Format commit messages as:

```
Scope(type[detail]): concise description

why: Explanation of necessity or impact.

what:
- Specific technical changes made
- Focused on a single topic
```

The blank line between the `why:` block and the `what:` block is
optional — useful when the `why:` body runs to multiple lines and the
two sections benefit from visual separation.

Common commit types:

- **feat**: New features or enhancements
- **fix**: Bug fixes
- **refactor**: Code restructuring without functional change
- **docs**: Documentation updates
- **chore**: Maintenance (dependencies, tooling, config)
- **test**: Test-related updates
- **style**: Code style and formatting
- **py(deps)**: Dependencies
- **py(deps[dev])**: Dev Dependencies
- **ai(rules[AGENTS])**: AI rule updates
- **ai(claude[rules])**: Claude Code rules (CLAUDE.md)

Subjects are plain English. Never put curriculum codes or other
repo-internal shorthand in the subject line — a reader of
`git log --oneline` should understand every title cold.

Example:

```
docs(README[setup]): Document the uv-based install

why: New clones failed on the old pip instructions.

what:
- Replace pip commands with uv equivalents
- Note the supported Python floor
```

For multi-line commits, use heredoc to preserve formatting:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Scope(type[detail]): concise description

why: Explanation of the change.

what:
- First change
- Second change
EOF
)"
```

Guidelines:

- Subject line at most 50 characters; body lines at most 72
- Imperative mood ("Add", "Fix" — not "Added", "Fixed")
- One topic per commit; blank line between subject and body
- Mark breaking changes with `BREAKING:`

## Documentation Standards

### Code blocks are paste-and-run units

One command per triple-backtick block, so pasting a block runs exactly
one intended action. Don't blur multiple commands annotated by comments
into the same block — explanations belong in prose above the block. A
multi-step sequence may share a block only when explicitly chained with
`;` / `; \` (the chain *is* the single action). Command menus are
per-command blocks with prose lead-ins, not tables.

## AI Slop Prevention

Treat AI slop as **review-hostile noise**, not as proof that text or
code is wrong. The goal is to maximize information density by removing
artifacts that make the repository harder to trust or navigate.

### The Anti-Slop Rubric

Before committing, audit all AI-assisted changes for these noise
patterns:

- **AI Signatures:** Remove "Generated by", footers, conversational
  filler ("Certainly!", "Here is..."), unexplained emojis (🤖, ✨), and
  AI-tool metadata.
- **Brittle References:** Avoid hard-coded line numbers, fragile
  file/test counts, dated "as of" claims, bare SHAs, and local
  absolute paths unless they are strict evidentiary artifacts (e.g.,
  benchmark logs).
- **Diff Narration:** Do not restate what moved, was renamed, or was
  removed in artifacts the downstream reader holds: code, docstrings,
  README, CHANGES, PR descriptions, or release notes. The diff and
  commit message already carry this history.
- **Branch-Internal Narrative:** Do not mention intermediate branch
  states, abandoned approaches, or "no longer" behavior unless users
  of a published release actually experienced the old state (**The
  Published-Release Test**).
- **Low-Value Scaffolding:** Remove ownerless TODOs (`TODO: revisit`),
  unused future-proofing, debug artifacts, and defensive wrappers that
  do not protect a currently reachable failure mode.
- **Prose Inflation:** Replace generic AI "tells" like *comprehensive,
  robust, seamless, production-ready, leverage, delve, tapestry,* and
  *best practices* with concrete descriptions of behavior,
  constraints, or trade-offs.
- **Coded Labels:** Write rules, options, and findings as plain
  imperatives. Don't tag them with codes like `[R1]`, `A1`, or
  `Option B` in artifacts a human reads — the reader shouldn't have to
  decode an index. Internal agent bookkeeping may use ids; shipped text
  may not.

### Durable Source Links

Link to a pinned revision, never to trunk. A pinned permalink is not a
brittle reference; an unlinked SHA dropped into prose is. `blob/main/…`
links rot silently — the file moves, lines shift, and the anchor lands
on unrelated code while still resolving.

- Prefer a release tag (`blob/v1.4.0/…`). Most durable, and it tells
  the reader which released version the claim held for.
- Otherwise use a 7-char commit ref (`blob/9a29b1a/…`) reachable from
  trunk. Use when there is no tag or the claim is about unreleased
  code. Never a PR-head SHA — it can be rebased or garbage-collected.
- Reserve `blob/main/…` for living documents meant to always show the
  latest state, such as a contributing guide.
- Line anchors (`#L120-L145`) are only safe on a pinned ref.

### Preservation & Context

**When unsure, leave the text in place and ask.** Subjective cleanup
must never be a reason to remove load-bearing rationale.

- **Preserve the "Why":** You MUST NOT delete comments that document
  invariants, protocol constraints, platform quirks, security
  boundaries, and upstream workarounds.
- **Evidence is Immune:** Preserve exact counts, dates, and SHAs when
  they serve as evidence in benchmark results, release notes, stack
  traces, or lockfiles.
- **Behavior Over Inventory:** A useful description explains what
  changed for the *system or user*; it does not provide an inventory
  of files or functions the diff already shows.

### The Published-Release Test

Long-running branches accumulate tactical decisions — renames,
refactors, attempts-then-reverts. When deciding what counts as
branch-internal, use trunk or the parent branch as the baseline — not
intermediate states inside the current branch. Ask:

> Did users of the most recently published release ever experience
> this old name, old behavior, or bug?

If the answer is **no**, it is branch-internal narrative. Move it to
the commit message and describe only the final state in the artifact.

**Keep in shipped artifacts:**

- Deprecations and migration guides for symbols that actually shipped.
- `### Fixes` entries for bugs that affected users of a published
  release.
- Comments explaining *why the current code looks this way*
  (invariants, platform quirks) that make sense to a reader who never
  saw the previous version.

### Cleanup in Hindsight

When applying these rules retroactively from inside a feature branch,
first establish scope by diffing against the parent branch (or trunk)
to identify which commits this branch actually introduced. Then:

- **In-branch commits:** Prompt the user with two options: `fixup!`
  commits with `git rebase --autosquash` to address each causal commit
  at its source, or a single cleanup commit at branch tip.
- **Trunk/Parent commits:** Default to leaving them alone. Act only on
  explicit user instruction. If the user opts in, fold the cleanup
  into a single commit at branch tip; do not rewrite shared history.
- **Scope guard:** If cleaning prior slop would touch a colleague's
  work or expand the branch beyond its stated goal, stay in lane:
  protect the current goal and leave prior slop alone.

### Change Discipline

- Make the smallest coherent change that solves the verified problem;
  keep unrelated cleanup out of it.
- Reuse an existing file, component, helper, API, or test before adding
  a new one. Modify in place when the change fits the file's
  responsibility.
- Keep new APIs private until a caller outside the module needs them.
- Add a file only for a durable boundary — a distinct responsibility,
  independent reuse, or splitting an oversized high-touch module — not
  for a single-use helper or a one-line re-export.

### Keep Instructions Lean

Treat this file like code and prune it.

- Delete a line whose removal would not cause a mistake.
- Move multi-step procedures into skills, path-specific rules into
  nested AGENTS.md files, and hard limits into hooks or CI.
- Keep only non-obvious, broadly applicable defaults here. Anything a
  reader can infer from the code, a manifest, or a linter does not
  belong.
